A set of three videos are supplemental material showing the [first version](<Supplemental Videos/S1.mp4>) of the device which was ultimately damaged by the pigs, [nose-poke training](<Supplemental Videos/S2.mp4>) on the second version, and a [discrimination task](<Supplemental Videos/S3.mp4>) on the second version.

A program written in python was used to train pigs to interact with the device and [is provided](<Programs and PCB/>) in this repository. It has a non-commercial use license which allows free use, modification, and distribution for non-commercial purposes.

The files to create the PCB used to interface the Raspberry Pi to external pieces are [also included](<Programs and PCB/>).
