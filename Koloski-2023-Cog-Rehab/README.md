# R code to accompany an upcoming publication 
  Koloski, M.F., Oâ€™Hearn, C.M., Frankot, M., Giesler, L.P., Ramanathan, D.S. Vonder Haar, C. Cognitive rehabilitation can improve brain injury-induced deficits in behavioral flexibility and impulsivity linked to impaired reward-feedback beta oscillations.

## The goal of this project was to establish and evaluate an animal model for assessing cognitive rehabilitation after TBI
Animal models are needed to better understand relevant biological variables that influence response to therapy or behavioral treatments.
In this study, we evaluated the use of simple cues as a means of engaging animals in specific target behaviors. 
In a probabilistic reversal learning (PbR) task that assess behavioral flexibility, rats with TBI showed deficits related to reward outcomes on electrophysiological measures in the OFC (Experiment 1). 
To correct this (Experiment 2), we introduced a salient cue above the high-probability lever in the PbR task. Rats with TBI were easily able to track this outcome and it resulted in increased cFos expression in the OFC.
To extend and evaluate this further (Experiment 3), we assessed whether a similar strategy could improve performance on the Differential Reinforcement of Low-Rate Behavior (DRL)-20 s task that assesses impulsivity.
TBI rats were able to reduce their impulsive responding using this cue. Moreover, the improvement persisted even when the cues were degraded, suggesting long-term improvement.

## This code can be used to perform the analyses in the manuscript. 
Several directories are available for analyses associated with the different behavioral tasks.
<br><br><b>Experiment 2: AST, PbR.</b> This experiment placed rats with a bilateral frontal TBI or Sham injury onto the Attentional Set Shifting task for assessment. 
After, rats were placed into Rehab or Control groups and tested on the Probabilistic Reversal Learning Task. Raw data for these will be available at the ODC-TBI.
<br><br><b>Experiment 3: DRL.</b> This experiment placed rats with a bilateral frontal TBI or Sham injury into Rehab or Control groups into the Differential Reinforcement of Low-Rate Behavior (DRL)-20 task. 
Rats were tested for five weeks, and then the cues in the rehab group were degraded to assess persistence. Raw data for these will be available at the ODC-TBI.
